            "text": "The universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago with the Big Bang, a massive expansion from a hot, dense point. This event set the universe in motion, expanding and cooling to form the first atoms. Over time, matter clumped together to form galaxies, stars, and planets, and the expansion of the universe continues today."

Over time, stars evolve: small stars become red giants, while massive stars may end their lives in explosive supernovae, forming black holes or neutron stars."

Formed from the collapse of massive stars, black holes exist in the centers of many galaxies, including the Milky Way. Despite being invisible, their presence is detected through the gravitational effects they have on nearby stars and gas."

From lush rainforests and vast deserts to deep oceans and frozen polar regions, these ecosystems support millions of species, each adapted to its environment. The beauty of nature lies not just in its diversity, but in the intricate relationships between plants, animals, and the elements. For example, the Amazon rainforest is known as the “lungs of the Earth” because of its vital role in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide."

Through photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight and convert it into energy, fueling the food chain and sustaining life. Forests, grasslands, and wetlands all depend on plants to maintain ecological balance. Forests, in particular, are home to over 80% of terrestrial species and play a significant role in regulating the Earth’s climate by storing carbon."

For example, bees are vital pollinators that help plants reproduce, while predators help control populations of other species, preventing overgrazing and promoting biodiversity. Humans, too, are part of the animal kingdom, and our relationship with nature affects the health of the planet."

Rivers, lakes, and oceans are crucial for transport, agriculture, and providing habitats for countless species. The water cycle, which involves the movement of water through the atmosphere, rivers, and oceans, helps maintain life-supporting conditions on Earth. Unfortunately, human activities, such as pollution and overuse of water resources, threaten this delicate balance."

AI systems are designed to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and language processing. From voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars, AI is increasingly becoming part of our daily lives. Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows computers to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming. AI is being used in diverse fields, including healthcare (for diagnosing diseases), finance (for fraud detection), and entertainment (for personalized recommendations). As AI technology advances, it holds the potential to transform industries and solve complex global challenges."
